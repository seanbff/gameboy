			<header>FOREWORD</header>
			<p> This Document was designed to help you programming the
Game BoyTM Classic, Game BoyTM Pocket, Super Game BoyTM
and Game BoyTM Color (basics - you will need additional
documents for GBC specific programming). It was ment to
be a complete handbook to start right off coding for
the hardware. The documents consists of three major
parts.</p>
			<p> The first is the 'GBSpec.txt' (also known as the Pan
Document) by Pan of Anthrox, Marat Fayzullin, Pascal
Felber, Paul Robson, Martin Korth, kOOPa. This will be
found in paragraph 1.

			<p>The following was typed up for informational purposes
regarding the inner workings on the hand-held game
machine known as Game Boy, manufactured and designed by
Nintendo Co., LTD. This info is presented to inform a
user on how their Game Boy works and what makes it

			<header>COMMAND OVERVIEW</header>
			<p> Since books on the Z80 are getting harder & harder to
find, hopefully the information here might be helpful
to those trying to understand assembly language
specific to GameBoy.
</p>
			<p>The GameBoy has instructions & registers similar to the
Intel 8080, Intel 8085, & Zilog Z80 microprocessors. It
has eight 8-bit registers A,B,C,D,E,F,H,L and two 16-
bit registers SP & PC:</p>
			<p>The Fleg Register consists of the following bits:</p>
			<code>
			7	6	5	4	3	2	1	0 <br>
			Z	N	H	C	O	O	O	O
			</code>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="sgb_commands">
			<header>SGB COMMANDS</header>
			<p> A SGB command transfer is 128 bits + a zero bit. The
first five bits of the first byte is the command byte.
The last 3 bits of the first byte represent the number
of 128 bit packages to be sent. Unused bits in a SGB
command transfer should be set to 0. </p>
			<p>
			 Most of the commands listed below only transfer one
package. The command bytes below are preceded by the #
character to remind you that they have to be shifted
left three times before used.
</p>

		<code>
			0 & 1 ($00,data) - Download color palettes 0 & 1 <br>
			2 & 3 ($01,data) - Download color palettes 2 & 3 <br>
			0 & 3 ($02,data) - Download color palettes 0 & 3 <br>
			1 & 2 ($03,data) - Download color palettes 1 & 2 <br>
		</code>
		<p>Palette 0:</p>

			<header>APPENDIX A</header>
			<p>Notes for getting assembly language programs that run
on an emulator to run on a real GB (by kOOPa, 2-Jan-98)</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Emulators tend to set all of RAM to $00 on power up.
Real GBs do NOT initialize RAM on power up. RAM is
filled with random values on power up. You must clear
it yourself if you wish it to be set to some known
value.</li> 
			<li>The real hardware could care less about the ROM
checksum ($14e,$14f) but the complement check ($14d)
MUST be correct or programs will "lock up" after
scrolling the Nintendo logo.<br> Use RGBFIX -V in the RGBDS development system to set
the checksum and the complement byte after each
source code compile. It doesn't matter whether you
program in C or assembly, this program will fix it. </li> 
			<li> The Nintendo scrolling graphic from $104 - $133 must
be accurate. If one byte of it is changed then your
programs will "lock up" after scrolling this graphic
logo.</li>
